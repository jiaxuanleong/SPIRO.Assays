The seed germination and root growth assays were developed for high-throughput analysis of data acquired by <a href="https://www.alyonaminina.org/spiro">SPIRO</a> and optimized for the typical plant model organism, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, but can be tuned for other species. 
<br>
Each assay comprises three major steps:
1. Raw data preprocessing using the ImageJ macro `SPIRO_Preprocessing`
2. Image analysis using the ImageJ macro `SPIRO_Germination` or `SPIRO_RootGrowth`
3. Quality control and anslysis of the quantitative data using the accompanying R scripts

<b>Figure.1</b> SPIRO semi-automated assays require preprocessing of the raw data to create 8-bit time-lapse stack files with scale set in cm. The preprocessed data can than be used either for seed germination or for root growth assay.
