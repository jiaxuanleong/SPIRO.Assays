This repository contains automated high-throughput analysis pipelines for seed germination and root growth, optimized for the typical plant model organism *Arabidopsis thaliana*. The pipelines were developed for use with [SPIRO](https://github.com/jonasoh/spiro). 

Each assay comprises three major steps:
* Raw data preprocessing (ImageJ macro)
* Image analysis (ImageJ macro)
* Quality control and statistical analysis (R scripts)

An overview of the separate analysis steps is provided below. A detailed manual will be provided soon.

# Image preprocessing

The first step in either of the SPIRO assays is preprocessing of the raw data. It is used for:
* Creating a time-lapse file for each analysed Petri plate
* Setting scale in cm
* Reducing file size by cropping off unnecessary background in images
* Converting images to 8-bit to facilitate further segmentation
* If needed, correcting for accidental drift during cube rotation

# Seed germination assay

</p>

The seed germination assay was designed for analysis of *Arabidopsis thaliana* germination, although it can be tweaked for use with other species. Germination detection is accomplished through measuring the perimeter of each seed over time, and groups are compared using the Kaplanâ€“Meier test. Complete details will be available in the assay manual.

# Root growth assay

</p>

The root growth assay measures primarily root length, and uses a mixed model to assess differences between groups. Complete details will be available in the assay manual.

</p>

The [SPIRO Assay Customizer](https://github.com/jonasoh/spiro-assay-customizer) is a companion tool for SPIRO Assays, which allows customizing assays in several ways (e.g., merging experiments, rearranging groups, etc). Its use is optional but recommended.
