<br>

The assays were developed for high-throughput analysis of data acquired by [SPIRO](https://www.alyonaminina.org/spiro), the [Smart Plate Imaging RObot](https://github.com/jonasoh/spiro). The assays were optimized for the typical plant model organism, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, but can be tuned for other species. 

Currently available SPIRO assays:
- Seed germination assay
- Root growth assay


Each assay comprises three major steps:
1. Raw data preprocessing using the ImageJ macro `SPIRO_Preprocessing`
2. Image analysis using the ImageJ macro `SPIRO_Germination` or `SPIRO_RootGrowth`
3. Quantitative data analysis using the accompanying R scripts


## Image processing

[**Preprocessing**](https://github.com/jiaxuanleong/SPIRO.Assays/tree/master/preprocessing)

This macro will process all four folders of a SPIRO experiment.

- combining separate images into one time-lapse stack file
- setting the scale
- resizing the stack by cropping off edges
- correcting for image drift

## Image analysis

[**Germination analysis**](https://github.com/jiaxuanleong/SPIRO.Assays/tree/master/germination)

SPIRO_Germination macro (ImageJ Macro Language):
This macro will analyze all four folders of a SPIRO experiment, using data processed by the SPIRO_Preprocessing macro.

- defining a range of time points that will be included into analysis
- selecting groups of seeds that will be analyzed together, e.g. the same genotype
- processing of images to identify seed positions 
- measurement of square and perimeter of each seed at each time point
- creating a time-lapse stack file illustrating quality of seed recognition for each group
- saving results as tab-delimited text files to be processed using [the accompanying R scripts](https://github.com/jiaxuanleong/spiro-SPIRO.Assays/tree/master/germination).

The bundled R scripts will analyze data generated by the `SPIRO_Germination` macro:

### Quality control
- quality control to remove any objects that were mistakenly recognized as seeds
- results are saved in tab-delimited output.txt file

### Data processing
- data processing to determine time of germination for each seed
- statistical analysis to determine the time at which 50% of seed germinated and to compare user-defined groups
- results are saved in tab-delimited text files

[**Root growth**](https://github.com/jiaxuanleong/SPIRO.Assays/tree/master/rootgrowth)

This ImageJ macro will analyze all four folders of a SPIRO experiment, using data processed by the SPIRO_Preprocessing macro.

- defining a range of time points that will be included into analysis
- selecting groups of seedlings that will be analyzed together, e.g. the same genotype
- processing of images to identify seedling positions 
- measurement of primary root length for each seed at each time point
- creating a time-lapse stack file illustrating quality of root recognition for each group
- saving results as tab-delimited text files to be processed using [bundled R scripts](https://github.com/jiaxuanleong/SPIRO.Assays/tree/master/rootgrowth).

The R script will then analyze the resulting data:

### Quality control
- quality control to remove any objects that were mistakingly recognized as primary roots
- results are saved in tab-delimited output.txt file

### Data processing
- data processing to determine root length for each seedling at each time point
- statistical analysis to determine the average rooth growth speed for each group
- results are saved in tab-delimited text files
